	* configure.in: don't start the version with 0

2001-09-13  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: added --enable-rpm-version, which accepts a dotted
	triple, and is used to make sure we compile something the compiler
	will accept, regardless of what ABI we intend to run against.  For
	cases like RPM 4.0, use 4.0.0 instead.

2001-06-19  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: change the way fake_openpty is handled.

2001-06-07  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: use $RPM_PREFIX/include/rpm as well as an
	include path, since rpm likes to #include <header.h> and the
	like.

2001-04-21  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* red-carpet.gpg: added new TurboLinux key for whatever that's
	worth

2001-04-10  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: quick hack to accept @ as a separator for
	rpm-static-libs

2001-04-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: sigh

2001-04-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: check for gnome-xml/tree.h not tree.h
	
2001-04-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: get rid of gnome-xml from the include path, sigh

2001-04-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* acconfig.h: #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN

	* configure.in: call AC_C_BIGENDIAN

2001-04-01  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* acconfig.h: add RC_RPM4

	* configure.in: added a few options, like --with-rpm-static-libs
	and --enable-backend-rpm4-static.  Best not to ask unless you need
	to.  Test for broken ugid.h for the rpm4 case, this could come
	back to haunt us with 4.0.2?

2001-03-30  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* acconfig.h: get rid of HAVE_RPM_4_0, add STATIC_RPM

	* configure.in: don't need all the rpm crap anymore, handle the
	dynamic and static rpm cases.

2001-03-18  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: put square brackets around the misc.h warning,
	otherwise the "see README-ugid" doesn't get printed after the
	comma.

2001-02-14  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: some rpm detection loving

2001-02-08  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: for rpm4 misc.h check, make sure that
	ugid.h really doesn't exist (it got put back in 7.0.90)

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: add some bz2 autoloving magic

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: remove -lbz2 from the RPMLIB_LIBS line

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: add AM_PATH_GLIB...

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: AC_WARN instead of AC_ERROR on no backends
	specified for the gimpy build system

2001-01-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: removed bz2 check from the rpm3 section, this
	wasn't correct
