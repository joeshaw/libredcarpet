	* acconfig.h: add RC_RPM4

	* configure.in: added a few options, like --with-rpm-static-libs
	and --enable-backend-rpm4-static.  Best not to ask unless you need
	to.  Test for broken ugid.h for the rpm4 case, this could come
	back to haunt us with 4.0.2?

2001-03-30  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* acconfig.h: get rid of HAVE_RPM_4_0, add STATIC_RPM

	* configure.in: don't need all the rpm crap anymore, handle the
	dynamic and static rpm cases.

	* configure.in: put square brackets around the misc.h warning,
	otherwise the "see README-ugid" doesn't get printed after the
	comma.

	* configure.in: some rpm detection loving

2001-02-08  Vladimir Vukicevic  <vladimir@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: for rpm4 misc.h check, make sure that
	ugid.h really doesn't exist (it got put back in 7.0.90)

	* configure.in: add some bz2 autoloving magic

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: remove -lbz2 from the RPMLIB_LIBS line

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: add AM_PATH_GLIB...

2001-01-29  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: AC_WARN instead of AC_ERROR on no backends
	specified for the gimpy build system

2001-01-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: removed bz2 check from the rpm3 section, this
	wasn't correct
