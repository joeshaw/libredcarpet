Building libredcarpet-sharp.

* Whenever any public API changes in libredcarpet, the following steps need to
  be done:

rm libredcarpet-api.xml
rm generated/*.cs
make
vi generated/Package.cs and remove these two lines:
   [DllImport("libredcarpet")]
   static extern IntPtr rc_package_new();

make


* Whenever you add/modify any *.custom files, you need to:

make update-generated
vi generated/Package.cs and remove these two lines:
   [DllImport("libredcarpet")]
   static extern IntPtr rc_package_new();

make


* Committing to CVS

Note that generated files (generated/*.cs) are also checked into CVS. That's
partly because of the required manual step, partly to make building for
packagers easier.
