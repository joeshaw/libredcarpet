2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* deptestomatic.c (main): no more rc_packman_set_packman, do
	rc_set_world, and rc_world_new needs a packman

2002-08-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* deptestomatic.c (print_solution): Compute a checksum for each
	solution, and compare it against the checksums of
	previously-displayed solutions.  This allows us to flag duplicate
	solutions when they occur.
	(report_solutions): Pass a list for the checksums into
	print_solution, free it when we are done.

2002-08-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* deptestomatic.c (load_channel): Set a fake base-id when creating
	channels.

	* deptestomatic.c (soln_cb): Use the rc_resolver_context_*_count
	functions instead of accessing the count struct elts (which are
	now gone).
	(load_channel): Simplified code by using g_pattern_match_simple
	and g_file_get_contents.  (Thank you glib-2.0!)  Use the channel
	name as the alias.  Remove code related to the channel_hash --- we
	can now use the in-RCWorld channel storage.
	(parse_xml_setup): Added support for undumping the RCWorld.

2002-08-14  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* deptestomatic.c: get rid of all references to virtual_provides

2002-08-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	glib-memory-allocation-ify strings returned by libxml.

	"upgrade" actions are reported.  They now print as "upgrade
	[oldpkg] => [newpkg]", not the other way around.

	* deptestomatic.c (parse_xml_trial): Added an "upgrade" command
	for trials.

2002-03-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	(get_package): Lookup packages in RCWorld, not in the channel.

2002-03-09  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>
