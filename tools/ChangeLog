	* Makefile.am: install pkg_to_xml

	* cur_to_xml.c (main): remove the call to _set_libdir

2002-08-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (pretty_print_pkg): get rid of the deps printing
	stuff for now.

2002-08-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (main): call rl_initialize, which we were never
	doing before and is apparently pretty important
	(main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal xml file

	* pkg_to_xml.c (main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal
	xml file

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (transact_step_cb): preparing was never added to
	the list of possible transaction steps here

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: the "run" command can now be followed by the
	word test; if it is, _transact is called with FALSE, and the
	transaction will have no effect (but will still be run).

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: packman_test_query and packman_test_remove
	updated to use rc_packman_query properly.

2002-06-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Added.  A small tool to query packages and dump
	out the associated XML.

2002-06-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: updated to work with HEAD

	* Makefile.am: build packman_test

	* .cvsignore: add packman_test
