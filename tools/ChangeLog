2005-01-03  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): update.

2004-11-30  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c (main): Update call to rc_packman_query_file call.
	Fix a memory leak while we're at it.

2003-09-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_find_file): Update this for the
	RCPackageSList API change.
	(packman_test_query_all, packman_test_query): Free the list of
	packages after unreffing it.

2003-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_run): No more repackaging.

2003-08-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* cur_to_xml.c, dep_lint.c, pkg-vercmp.c, pkg_to_xml.c: None of
	these need to parse the distro xml anymore, since that's separated
	from rc-distman.  RC_PACKMAN_TYPE will need to be set instead of
	RC_DISTRO_TARGET, however, to determine which packaging backend to
	use.

2003-07-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Print out the packman error if
	rc_packman_query_file() returns NULL.

2003-05-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Add a rc_debug handler is RC_DEBUG is set

2003-04-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_file_list): Show a lot more
	information about the files in a package if "dump" is passed as
	the second paramater to the command.

2003-04-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: Add a "file_list" command which lists the files
	within a certain package.

2003-04-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* dep_lint.c (try_to_install_everything): Use our new-style
	channel wildcards.

2003-04-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Nuke the RC_DISTRIBUTIONS_FILE stuff, it's in
	libredcarpet's internal distro info parser.

2003-03-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Allow the user to specify a distributions.xml file
	to read from (instead of the built-in one) by setting the
	RC_DISTRIBUTIONS_FILE environment variable.  (#39771)

2003-03-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_run): Use transaction flags instead
	of just TRUE/FALSE, handle a "repackage" flag and pass it into
	rc_packman_transact().

2003-03-13  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* dep_lint.c: Added.  Take a rc dump file and iterate across the
	uninstalled packages, doing a dependency resolution for each.
	Print out information about each success/failure.

2002-09-11  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): fix the usage message to not expect a
	package type argument.  BTW the argc check was borken before,
	since expecting 3 arguments means you need an argc of 4 in C.  Get
	rid of the rpmman / debman stuff, just use rc_distman_new, and
	rely on RC_DISTRO_TARGET to help you do the right thing.  That way
	we don't really need to know the package type, just the system for
	which we're doing the comparison.

2002-09-06  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: Disable command completion if we are using a
	very old version of readline... like, for example, the one that
	ships with RH62.  In a perfect world we would use proper configure
	tests to detect the capabilities of our readline and support both
	the old and new APIs, but it just doesn't seem worth it.

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): no more rc_packman_set_packman

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): rc_packman_version_compare instead of
	rc_package_spec_compare

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add (and install) pkg-vercmp.

	* pkg-vercmp.c: Tool to take two EVRs and the packaging backend
	type and returns "gt", "lt", or "eq".

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* cur_to_xml.c (main): Added a call to rc_distro_parse_xml, so
	that we don't assert on start-up.

2002-08-09  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_query_all): GQuark fixup
	(packman_test_list): GQuark fixup

2002-08-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: install pkg_to_xml

	* cur_to_xml.c (main): remove the call to _set_libdir

2002-08-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (pretty_print_pkg): get rid of the deps printing
	stuff for now.

2002-08-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (main): call rl_initialize, which we were never
	doing before and is apparently pretty important
	(main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal xml file

	* pkg_to_xml.c (main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal
	xml file

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (transact_step_cb): preparing was never added to
	the list of possible transaction steps here

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: the "run" command can now be followed by the
	word test; if it is, _transact is called with FALSE, and the
	transaction will have no effect (but will still be run).

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: packman_test_query and packman_test_remove
	updated to use rc_packman_query properly.

2002-06-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Added.  A small tool to query packages and dump
	out the associated XML.

2002-06-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: updated to work with HEAD

	* Makefile.am: build packman_test

	* .cvsignore: add packman_test
