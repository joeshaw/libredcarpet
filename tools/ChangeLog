	* packman_test.c: Disable command completion if we are using a
	very old version of readline... like, for example, the one that
	ships with RH62.  In a perfect world we would use proper configure
	tests to detect the capabilities of our readline and support both
	the old and new APIs, but it just doesn't seem worth it.

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): no more rc_packman_set_packman

2002-08-28  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* pkg-vercmp.c (main): rc_packman_version_compare instead of
	rc_package_spec_compare

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add (and install) pkg-vercmp.

	* pkg-vercmp.c: Tool to take two EVRs and the packaging backend
	type and returns "gt", "lt", or "eq".

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* cur_to_xml.c (main): Added a call to rc_distro_parse_xml, so
	that we don't assert on start-up.

2002-08-09  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (packman_test_query_all): GQuark fixup
	(packman_test_list): GQuark fixup

2002-08-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: install pkg_to_xml

	* cur_to_xml.c (main): remove the call to _set_libdir

2002-08-05  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (pretty_print_pkg): get rid of the deps printing
	stuff for now.

2002-08-03  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (main): call rl_initialize, which we were never
	doing before and is apparently pretty important
	(main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal xml file

	* pkg_to_xml.c (main): call rc_distro_parse_xml using the internal
	xml file

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c (transact_step_cb): preparing was never added to
	the list of possible transaction steps here

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: the "run" command can now be followed by the
	word test; if it is, _transact is called with FALSE, and the
	transaction will have no effect (but will still be run).

2002-07-25  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: packman_test_query and packman_test_remove
	updated to use rc_packman_query properly.

2002-06-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* pkg_to_xml.c: Added.  A small tool to query packages and dump
	out the associated XML.

2002-06-06  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* packman_test.c: updated to work with HEAD

	* Makefile.am: build packman_test

	* .cvsignore: add packman_test
