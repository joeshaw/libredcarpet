CONTRIBUTING
------------

Contributions to libredcarpet are more than welcome.  libredcarpet is
written in C and heavily uses the glib library.

Discussion takes place on the rc-devel@ximian.com mailing list.
Patches should be sent there, and should follow the existing stylistic
conventions, be accompanied by a ChangeLog entry, and sent in GNU
unified diff format (diff -u).

Please DO NOT commit to CVS without approval from one of the
maintainers.

BUILDING
--------

Building libredcarpet can be tricky.  Hopefully we'll have snapshot
packages available soon, which should remove some of the pain.

* glib 2

  First, you will need glib2.  It comes with Red Hat 7.3 and up, and
  probably every distro after.  If you don't have it, you can get it
  from http://www.gtk.org.

* RPM

  If you plan to build libredcarpet with RPM support, you will need
  some version of RPM, from 3.0.3 to 4.0.4, available at build time.
  Additionally, while libredcarpet does not link against librpm.so,
  the RPM libraries will be a runtime dependency of your program.

* DPKG

  You don't even need to be on a Debian system to build with DPKG
  support.  At runtime, it won't work unless you're on a Debian system
  -- or, more accurately, unless you have dpkg in your PATH.

To build libredcarpet, you need to pass the appropriate backend flags
to autogen.sh/configure.  If you need RPM support, pass in:

  --enable-backend-rpm --enable-rpm-version=x.y.z

To build with DPKG support, pass in:

  --enable-backend-dpkg

Both backends may be specified simultaneously, if you want.  This is
especially helpful while doing development, so that you don't break
the compile on a system you don't run.
